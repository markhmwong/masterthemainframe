       <h1>COBOL</h1>
       <p>A brief overview of the COBOL programming language with personalised notes. Using Danny Companez and Derek Banas and as references.</p>
       <p>Despite the many calls of modern programmers calling COBOL a dead language, it still reigns supreme (like good old Kimmy over in North Korea); dominating financial transactions across the world. US, Australia, parts of asia and China rely on COBOL to manage their financial transactions.</p>

            <h2>File Structure</h2>
            <p>You'll find that COBOL is semi based on columns in it's structure, as it's origins began and derived from using punch cards.</p>
            <p>First 6 columns used to organise punch cards.</p>
            <p>7th column is used for a * to denote a comment.</p>
